=head1 DESCRIPTION

This simple shell script just updates (or creates) a miniature CPAN mirror as
described in CPAN::Mini.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

C<minicpan> will read the file C<~/.minicpanrc> to get configuration
information.  The file is a simple set of names and values, as in the following
example:

 local:  /home/rjbs/mirrors/minicpan/
 remote: http://your.favorite.cpan/cpan/
 exact_mirror: 1

=head1 TO DO

Improve command-line options.

=head1 AUTHORS

Randal Schwartz <F<merlyn@stonehenge.com>> had the bright idea and wrote the
original implementation.

Ricardo SIGNES <F<rjbs@cpan.org>> brazenly took the script, made a module and
distribution, and slowly allowed it to gain features.

This code was copyrighted in 2004, and is released under the same terms as Perl
itself.
